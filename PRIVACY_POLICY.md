# Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Button Extension

**Last Updated:** November 28, 2025

## Overview

WhatsApp Button ("the Extension") is a Shopify Theme App Extension that adds a floating WhatsApp button to your store. This privacy policy explains how the Extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**We DO NOT collect, store, or process any data.**

The Extension:
- Does not collect any personal information from store visitors
- Does not collect any merchant data
- Does not track user behavior
- Does not use cookies
- Does not send data to any external servers
- Does not integrate with any third-party services except WhatsApp (when a user clicks the button)

## How the Extension Works

1. Merchants configure their WhatsApp phone number and preferences in the Shopify theme editor
2. A floating button appears on the storefront
3. When visitors click the button, they are redirected to WhatsApp (web or app) using WhatsApp's official `wa.me` URL format
4. All communication happens directly between the visitor and the merchant through WhatsApp

## Third-Party Services

The only external service involved is **WhatsApp** (owned by Meta):
- When users click the button, they are redirected to `https://wa.me/[phone-number]`
- WhatsApp's own privacy policy applies to conversations: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy
- We do not have access to any WhatsApp conversations or data

## Data Storage

The Extension stores only configuration data in your Shopify theme settings:
- WhatsApp phone number
- Button styling preferences (colors, size, position)
- Default message text
- Tooltip text

This data is stored securely within your Shopify admin and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Merchant Responsibilities

As a merchant using this Extension, you are responsible for:
- Ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Informing your customers about your communication channels
- Maintaining appropriate privacy policies for your store
- Handling customer data through WhatsApp in compliance with applicable laws

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or store any data, there is no data security risk associated with this Extension. All configuration data is stored securely within Shopify's infrastructure.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.
